# Read this before making any modifications to the image gallery

## Directions 
* download the image you want to upload to the gallery.
* use an image compressor (like https://imagecompressor.com/) to reduce the size of the image. 
    * I recommend using 50% quality on imagecompressor.com
* Log into firebase (firebase.google.com) with the hosting account and click on "Go to console" in the top right. 
* select the project that appears.
* once inside the project console select "Storage" from the navigation bar on the right.
* enter the gallery_images folder in Storage and click the "Upload File" button.
* After the new image is uploaded click on it in firebase and an element will open up on the right of the page.
* In that element that just popped up click on the link under "name". It will be blue and have an underline.
* Copy the URL for that image.
* Go to the orchestra website homepage and click on "login" in the footer.
* Login to the admin console and under Homepage > Gallery add the URL that you copied to the input box labeled "Image Link" and add a brief (<20 words) description of the image in the input box labeled "Description".
* click the "Add image to Gallery" button and you're done!
